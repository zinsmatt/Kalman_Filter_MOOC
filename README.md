# Kalman Filter MOOC


(see [KalMOOC](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/jaulin/kalmooc.html))


Localization with **Kalman Filter**.

The robots can measure angles (with a *goniometer*) from landmarks or from the other robot if the distance is small.
Using these measurements, each robot can estimate its position and we show how their <span style="color:green">covariance</span> evolve.
